[Status: on going] Automatic analysis of changes in horse prices in Howrse (online game) using web scraping
Project context: Years ago Howrse used to have a page where you could check how prices of each breed were changing in the last month, but its no longer supported, so i decided to make a substitution, despite the fact that im not playing the game anymore. Ultimately, the goal is to allow user to choose breed in simple gui and then display charts visualising it's prices from the chosen period of time (last week, month, year).

Functions implemanted so far:
  1. Collecting data from auctions about price, horse's breed and date of the sale
  2. Saving data to file
